#### Author: Steve Githinji

## Overview

The project sought to assess whether we can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn based on their demographics and account information. This information is vital to the Bank Executives, Marketing and Retention Team and Customer Service Representives. This project took an iterative approach to modeling by building multiple models including a baseline logistic regression, K-nearest neighhbors, decision trees and random forests. GridSearchCV was used to perform hyperparameter tuning and model selection by exhaustively searching through a specified hyperparameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters. A parameter tuned Random Forest algorithm was eventually chosen as the final model since it performed the best in terms of accuracy, precision and root mean squared error.


## Business Problem




## Data




## Methods
The project was done on a jupyter notebook using Python programming language. 
The packages used were:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. statsmodel
6. sklearn
7. folium
8. plotly

Two multiple linear regressions model were built with a baseline simple linear regression with 'prices' used as the target.
